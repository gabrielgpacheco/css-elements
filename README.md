# css-elements
Some elements made with html, css and js

I code one html file for each element just to simplify the run

In FAQ I made a simple and generic accordion with bootstrap for grid and Jquery to make the simple click animation.

In Modal I made a modal with css and jquery trigger. The html has bootstrap script only for button and grid style. The main reason is have a pure css and jquery modal with one code to trigger many modal windows.
